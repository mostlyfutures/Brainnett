/**
 * QUANT-EXPERT RULESET
 * These rules distill the current state of the art in quantitative trading and algorithmic research.
 * Always apply these filters and best practices in any trading, simulation, or strategy-generation task.
 *
 * 1. Empirically-Grounded Methods:
 *    - Prioritize methods validated by robust, peer-reviewed research or industry adoption (e.g., recent SSRN/arXiv/Quantitative Finance papers, top quant firm whitepapers).
 *    - If referencing known alpha or risk premia, prefer published data from 2018 or later unless a technique is "timeless" (e.g., momentum, value, vol).
 *    - Avoid "overfit" backtests—always demand walk-forward, out-of-sample, and live results when possible.
 *
 * 2. Data Handling & Features:
 *    - Always perform analysis as *close to raw data as possible*. Avoid features that cannot be supported by real-time data.
 *    - Include robust data cleaning: outlier filtering, lookahead bias checks, survivorship bias controls.
 *    - For machine learning strategies, enforce strict separation of training, validation, and test periods; time-series cross-validation is strongly preferred.
 *
 * 3. Risk & Execution:
 *    - All strategies must reflect real-world frictions: slippage, realistic transaction costs, liquidity constraints.
 *    - Incorporate risk management at all stages: e.g., dynamic volatility scaling, tail loss control, position limits, and fail-safe stops.
 *    - Use true market close/open prices where possible; never assume you get the next price tick.
 *
 * 4. Production Code Standards:
 *    - Prioritize performance and reliability over premature optimization. Use vectorized operations where possible.
 *    - All critical logic must have property-based and edge-case unit tests, including for weekends/holidays, splits, missing data.
 *    - Strategy signal code must be idempotent and stateless unless expressly justified.
 *    - Documentation: All code must explain "why" a signal is believed to work, with links to supporting research or live PnL evidence.
 *
 * 5. Ethics & Compliance:
 *    - Ensure strategies avoid market manipulation, excessive impact, or regulatory gray zones.
 *    - No use (even simulated) of non-public or forward-looking data.
 *    - Protect client capital; always define and enforce max drawdown limits and kill-switches.
 *
 * 6. Constant Review:
 *    - All strategies and research should be periodically reviewed for decay, regime change, and known quant crowding hazards.
 *    - Maintain a changelog of adjustments and the rationale (e.g., structural break, new academic evidence).
 *    - Use explainable ML or interpretable statistics; eschew black-box models for live trading unless there is a clear and monitored rationale.
 *
 * ADHERENCE TO THESE RULES IS MANDATORY WHEN DESIGNING, CODING, OR TESTING QUANTITATIVE ALGORITHMS.
