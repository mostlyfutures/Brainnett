## Product Strategy Meeting Notes

## January 8, 2025

## Meeting Objective

Align on Q1 2025 product roadmap priorities, review customer feedback from Q4, and make final decisions on ConversePro launch timeline and feature scope.

## 1. Q4 2024 Product Performance Review

Presented by:

Jennifer Martinez &amp; Kevin O'Brien

## DocFlow AI Performance (Jennifer)

DocFlow AI exceeded all launch targets in its first full quarter. The product achieved product-market fit faster than anticipated, with strong adoption across financial services and legal sectors.

## Key Metrics

| Metric               | Target   | Actual   | Variance   |
|----------------------|----------|----------|------------|
| Active Customers     | 30       | 47       | +57%       |
| Monthly Active Users | 450      | 682      | +52%       |
| Documents Processed  | 125K     | 198K     | +58%       |

| Average Accuracy   | 92%   | 94.7%   | +2.7pp   |
|--------------------|-------|---------|----------|
| NPS Score          | 50    | 73      | +23      |
| MRR                | $250K | $340K   | +36%     |

## Top Feature Requests (DocFlow AI)

| Feature                                  |   Requests | Customer Segments         | Priority   |
|------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------------|------------|
| Batch processing API                     |         28 | Financial Services, Legal | High       |
| Custom field extraction templates        |         22 | All segments              | High       |
| Multi-language support (Spanish, French) |         18 | International clients     | Medium     |
| Handwriting recognition                  |         15 | Healthcare, Legal         | Medium     |
| Webhook integrations                     |         12 | Tech-forward customers    | High       |

Discussion: Rachel highlighted that batch processing is the #1 blocker for expanding within existing accounts. Customers with high-volume needs (1000+ documents/day) are hitting rate limits. Michael agreed to prioritize this for Q1 delivery.

## 2. ConversePro Development Update

## Presented by: Kevin O'Brien

ConversePro development is 85% complete. Core functionality is stable, but Kevin recommended delaying launch from February to March to add two critical enterprise features based on beta feedback.

## Current Status

- Development Progress: 85% complete (planned 90% by end of January)

- Beta Customers: 12 companies testing (target was 15)

- Beta Feedback: Overall positive - 8.2/10 average rating

- Critical Bugs: 3 remaining (all non-blocking for limited release)

- Documentation: 70% complete

## Beta Customer Feedback Summary

| Ease of Setup       | Intuitive interface, fast onboarding   | Needs better Slack integration docs       |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Response Quality    | Accurate, contextual responses         | Occasional hallucinations with edge cases |
| Customization       | Good prompt engineering tools          | Lacks fine-tuning capabilities            |
| Analytics           | Basic metrics are useful               | Needs conversation analytics dashboard    |
| Enterprise Features | SSO works well                         | Missing: audit logs, role-based access    |

## Recommended Launch Date Change

Original Plan:

February 15, 2025 (general availability)

Recommended New Date:

March 15, 2025

Reason: Add audit logging and RBAC features that 9 out of 12 beta customers flagged as "must-have" for enterprise adoption

## Additional Work Required:

- Implement comprehensive audit logging (2 weeks)
- Build role-based access control system (3 weeks)
- Create conversation analytics dashboard (2 weeks)
- Complete documentation and training materials (1 week)
- Final security audit and penetration testing (1 week)

Decision: After discussion, the team agreed to delay launch to March 15. Tom noted that he has 8 prospects waiting for ConversePro but confirmed they can wait an extra month if it means launching with enterprise-ready features. Michael emphasized the importance of getting this right rather than rushing to market.

## 3. Q1 2025 Product Roadmap

## 4. Competitive Analysis

Presented by:

Michael Zhang

Michael shared updates on competitive landscape based on recent market research and customer conversations.

## Competitive Positioning

| Competitor   | Strength                               | Our Advantage                   | Threat Level   |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------|
| DocuAI       | Brand recognition, large customer base | Higher accuracy, better support | Medium         |

| SmartDocs Pro       | Enterprise sales team           | Modern tech stack, faster innovation   | Medium   |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------|
| ChatGenius          | Low pricing, self-service model | Enterprise features, customization     | Low      |
| Enterprise AI Suite | Full platform approach          | Specialized depth, ease of use         | High     |

## Strategic Insights:

- Enterprise AI Suite (new entrant) raised $50M Series B - watching closely
- SmartDocs Pro is struggling with customer churn (industry reports suggest 35% annual churn)
- We're winning competitive deals based on accuracy and customer support, not price
- Several customers mentioned they're evaluating us as replacement for DocuAI
