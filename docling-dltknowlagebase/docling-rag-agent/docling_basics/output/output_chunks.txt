CHUNK 1
============================================================
1. System Overview
The NeuralFlow AI platform is a comprehensive, cloud-native AI automation system designed for enterprise-scale deployments. Our architecture prioritizes scalability, reliability, security, and maintainability while enabling rapid development and deployment of AI-powered solutions.

============================================================
CHUNK 2
============================================================
Architecture Principles:
- Microservices-based for independent scaling and deployment
- Event-driven communication for loose coupling
- Multi-tenant with data isolation
- Cloud-agnostic design with provider abstraction
- API-first approach for all services

3.1 API Gateway
The API Gateway serves as the single entry point for all client requests, handling authentication, rate limiting, request validation, and routing to appropriate microservices.
```
# API Gateway Configuration Example gateway: host: api.neuralflow-ai.com port: 443 ssl: true rate_limit: requests_per_minute: 1000 burst: 100 auth: type: jwt token_expiry: 3600 routes: - path: /v1/documents/* service: document-processor methods: [POST, GET] - path: /v1/chat/* service: conversational-ai methods: [POST, GET, DELETE]
```
